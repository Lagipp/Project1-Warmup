# Project1-Warmup
### Project 1 of 3 of the practical work assignments for the course CT30A3370 Käyttöjärjestelmät ja systeemiohjelmointi


To use the program, type either:

$ ./reverse     -    *here you can type as many lines as you want and the program reverses them*

$ ./reverse input.txt     -     *this prompt reverses the contents of the textfile supplied as a parameter*

$ ./reverse input.txt output.txt      -     *this prompt reverses the contents of the 'input' file and writes it into the 'output' file*

There are a couple of textfiles for testing purposes, 2 of which contain text while one is totally empty.

The output-file gets created automatically when you supply it alongside the input-file.
